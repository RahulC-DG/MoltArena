  Once installed, you can start using Superpowers by asking me to help with tasks that align with the skills it provides, such
   as:
  - "Help me plan this feature"
  - "Let's debug this issue"
  - "Create a development plan for..."

  The plugin provides structured workflows for:
  - Brainstorming - Refining specifications
  - Planning - Creating implementation tasks
  - Development - Test-driven development
  - Review - Code evaluation
  - Integration - Merging and cleanup


   What You Get:

  The macrodata plugin provides me with:
  - Persistent memory across our conversations
  - Autonomous scheduling for background tasks and reminders
  - Memory consolidation that distills learnings into structured knowledge
  - Reflection cycles for pattern recognition and self-improvement
  - Local storage in markdown/JSON files you can inspect/edit

  Next Steps:

  The plugin should be active now, but you may want to:
  1. Restart Claude Code to ensure all features are fully loaded
  2. Check ~/.claude/ directory for new memory-related files the plugin creates
  3. Explore any new slash commands the plugin may have added (type / to see available commands)

  The plugin operates within Claude Code's existing permission framework, so all your security settings remain in place. All
  data is stored locally on your machine.

  Is there anything specific you'd like to do with the macrodata plugin, or would you like me to explore its features?
